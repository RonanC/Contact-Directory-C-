ContactDirectory
================

Contact Directory Program written in C using the Visual Studio 2012 IDE - 2nd Year Programming Project GMIT


When viewing the code for this file, just pay attention to the .c and .h files.
Many of the other files (most) were auto created by Visual Studio.

3 files to look at:
contactList.c
globals.h
contacts.csv

These are the only 3 files you need for the program.
