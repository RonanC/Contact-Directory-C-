ContactDirectory

Overview
-----
2nd Year Programming Project GMIT


About
-----
This application was created to show off the use of the C language with a strong emphasis on pointers and sorting.

I created my own custom version of a bubble sort whereby you could sort the contacts by a chosen column. 
You can add or remove contacts.
The application remembers state by saving and loading to a CSV file.


Tools Used
-----
This program was written in C using the Visual Studio 2012 IDE.


Extras
-----
When viewing the code for this file, just pay attention to the .c and .h files.
Many of the other files (most) were auto created by Visual Studio.

3 files to look at:
contactList.c
globals.h
contacts.csv

These are the only 3 files you need for the program.
